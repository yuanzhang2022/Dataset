# Dataset: [PitNET_mRNA]

This dataset is derived from publicly available data originally published by [Fan Zhang/State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering and Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Human Phenome Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.] at [原始链接或 DOI].

## Description
This dataset includes multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics) from 200 pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNET) patients. The data reveals molecular heterogeneity and identifies potential diagnostic markers (e.g., GNAS copy number gain) and therapeutic targets (e.g., CDK6, TWIST1, EGFR, VEGFR2). Proteomics-based classification identified 7 clusters, including an invasive subgroup overexpressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Immune subtyping highlights alterations in the JAK1-STAT1-PDL1 and JAK3-STAT6-FOS/JUN axes, suggesting potential immunotherapy strategies.

## Usage
This dataset is suitable for studying PitNET molecular mechanisms, improving clinicopathological classification, and exploring targeted therapies or immunotherapies. Researchers can use this data to validate diagnostic markers, identify therapeutic targets, or develop predictive models for tumor behavior. The dataset is intended for non-commercial research use, and users are encouraged to cite the original study.
